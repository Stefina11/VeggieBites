      <p className="chi-siamo-text">
      We believe in the benefits of a mostly vegetarian diet. <br />Scientific studies have shown that a 
      vegetarian diet reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, some cancers, and high blood pressure. 
      The resulting benefits are not only related to personal health, but also to the health of the environment and animals.
